## Detection of similarities in consumption patterns, a NILM approach

This set of scripts are part of research in NILM methods based on the detection of similarities on consumption patterns.

### Datasets

Datasets were generated based on the well-known dataset UK-DALE, using the scripts 
`normalize-nilmtk-dataset.py` and `convert-csv-to-h5.py`.
The resulting datasets can be downloaded from that
